Snowfire API wrapper/helper library
=================================

This bundle of classes should be an unobtrusive way of communicating
with mimmin's Snowfire (www.mimmin.com).

This is still in beta phase, and the API and library are subject to change.

If you have any questions or feedback, feel free to contact me at markus@mimmin.com.
